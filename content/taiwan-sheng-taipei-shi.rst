First of all, I will have to explain what is 'sheng' and what is 'shi'.
'Sheng' means province and 'shi' means city. Private cars have two types
of registration zone: Taiwan Sheng and Taipei Shi, which means if a car
is registered anywhere outside Taipei in Taiwan , it will have 'Taiwan
Sheng' on its number plate.

Please do not judge my political view from this since I just found that
the above observation is a little bizarre and funny. To be honest, I
have been thinking for quite sometime, whether Taiwan is justified to be
a country from historical point of view. In my naive logic, the answer
will be 'Yes'. Simply speaking, Communist party knocked down the
government formed by Kuoming party then took the lead of the country
while Kuoming party fled to Taiwan after their defeat and ever since the
two parts went different ways and acted as two different countries. I
have no idea since when, China (People's Republic of China) started
officially claiming 'Taiwan is part of China' even though I do remember
I read in my textbooks that 'Taiwan is a province of China'. My naive
judgement is 'in history, the fight between two armies either resulted
in one big kingdom or two kingdoms with two kings or two emperors; in
our case, communist party did not really eliminate Kuoming party army so
it resulted in two kingdoms'. It is overly simplified politics and of
course does not at all represent the reality but hopefully some of you
would think it makes sense.

Do Chinese people (including people from both mainland and Taiwan)
really care? I think most of people do not care. Of course, if you do
ask a person from mainland 'Do you think Taiwan is independant', I guess
he or she will automatically gives you a default 'No' simply they get
used to the idea and also it is cool to have a great (large or vast)
country. Do Taiwanese care? I guess not too much, since they have just
elected a president who has openly stressed he would like to keep a good
tie with China even though there are a few people a little frightened
that the tie is going to be too close. Do I care? I think I only care to
an extend whether it is good for economics. For now, it is no good,
since strictly speaking still no direct flight since even the non-stop
weekend flight still has to make a detour above Hongkong and then head
back north to Taiwan, which takes around 4 hours from Shanghai or
Nanjing but instead, a real direct flight in space from Shanghai to
Taipei should be only one and half hours. Other disadvantages such as
'extreme difficulty for a Chinese to get a work permit in Taiwan and
vice Versa' and other restrictions in trading and communication.
Politics intends to cover the fact: we as Chinese all have same root
afterall and we are just same people. Why does politics (a game of few
people fighting for the power) create the chance for us to hate each
other and make enemies with each other.

Heard a nasty story about Mr A Bian, the former president. He can't
stand up in the North Taiwan now since people in the North (more
educated according to my taxi driver:)) are Kuoming pro; while he can
only talk in front of farmers from the South (I have not been to the
South, so tentatively borrowing the words from my taxi driver again).
What kind of person is he really? My first impression of judging people
is normally quite accurate, which consequently granted me a safe trip
home at a strange place with pizza delivery, and my impression of A Bian
is just ugly 'cunning, non trust-able, irresponsible ...'. The instant
proof is that he, his son with his blood and his daughter in law denied
their crime and the poor paralyzed lady, A Bian's wife and the son's
mum, became the easiest and most natural scapegoat. Well, have to say, A
Bian must have been a good husband since he was so obedient to his wife
that he dared to abuse his power.

So much for today, my third night and second day in Taiwan. Biased
opinions can't be avoided since I have just been charged with communist
power for a month:)
