I dedicate my Saturday afternoon and evening to my corner blog!

I was hoping I could make better use of my non-office hours, but
sometimes I could not really draw a line between work and non-work. When
life comes to a 'work-sleep-work' pattern, one needs to think better
whether there is anything more you would like to have. Ralf and me both
share the same work ethic, but from time to time we need to alarm
ourselves to dedicate ourselves to some other stuff. For example, I need
to update my blog for my loyal readers:)

All in all, I have started my TSLH (Travel-Suitcase Live-Hotel) life
since I first went to Dresden on Feb 11th. But officially I only became
homeless after my Dresden trip. March 15th, a marvelous day, I, with
help from Joost and Corry, moved out of my temporary home for less than
1.5 months at Erwin's attic. Sunday, Mar 16th, Olga drove me to Schiphol
and I started my journey to US.

I was in Dresden for 5 weeks. People like to say Dresden (Florence on
the Elbe) is built on ruins because of the blanket bombing close to the
end of second world war by British air force and United States Army Air
Force. This bombing still remains controversial since the war was about
to end anyway at the time. The rumor went around as the British did not
want the Russian to enjoy too much on the German ground. Nevertheless,
Dresden is still entitled as one of the most important historical and
cultural city and it attracts from all over the world. Of course, I
would not want to miss my chance either. During the time being there, I
walked around Altstadt (Old town) many times and dined at Neustadt
almost all the time. Altstadt has Frauenkirche, Procession of Dukes
(mural), Hofkirche, Semper Oper Haus with the statue of King John of
Saxony in the front , Zwinger and so on. Frauenkirche was completely
destroyed and the restoration (reconstruction) was accomplished in 2004.
I was not amazed by the church itself since I have seen so many more
magnificent churches in other parts of Europe, however I appreciate the
efforts the public has put in to restore the the church to its original
stand. Procession of Dukes depicts every ruler of Saxony from the middle
ages to the Prussian expansion. I visited the Zwinger for the first time
at dusk. There is a garden inside surrounded by four wings which house
the museum of classic or traditional art and the armory. The other day,
Fei and I were passionate enough to purchase a yearly pass for access to
almost all the museums in Dresden. I had to admit that I only used it on
that day and fortunately the yearly pass was not too costly afterall.
Another attraction which the supervisor brought us to is the 360 degree
panorama painting in the Panometer, which was based on the scene of
Dresden around 200 years ago. Inside, you can go all the way up to the
center tower and enjoy the view of Dresden from dawn to dusk with the
lighting effect. Among all of these, my favourite is the Zwinger and the
Panometer painting.

I was not really lonely during the time in Dresden. I went out with Hans
for dinner almost every evening since he is bothered to cook either.
Moreover we have a very hospitable supervisor, who occasionally invited
us out for coma safe (coma drinking). They are good drinkers and also
party animals. A few times, I escaped to Fei's flat and sat around her
stove enjoying the hot pot. Delicious! As for the food, I had to mention
my on-fire experience at Devil's kitchen at Neustat. In the beginning, I
was not amazed by the spiceness of the food so the restaurant owner was
so kind to offer me some spice which I believe is **Habanero,**\ bell
shaped devil which puts my throat and stomach instantly on fire. The
restaurant owner felt so sorry when I was tearfully hopping around but
he did not anticipate I was stupid enough to throw the whole piece into
my mouth just like a piece of snack. What an experience! However, this
did not cool my fever for spicy food at all.

Fei and I also planned a trip to Prague. It is certainly worth it.
Prague is one of those cities you have to explore on foot, full of
stunning surprises. We set our feet across the Vltava river over the
Charles' bridge towards the biggest castle in the world ' Prague
Castle'. On the Charles' bridge, there are a lot of artistic performance
such as bridge band, puppet show, portrait drawing and so on. Prague
Castle is sitting up the hill to present its status. We did not have a
chance to enter the castle since the queue was just too long. Instead,
we visited St George Church, old royal palace and golden all the tiny
Gift shops, which I liked most:) On the other side of Vltava river we
visited old town square. We bumped into some Czech performance at the
center square and tried some local delicacies, also admired the
astronomical clock. By chance, we also run into Jan Saudek's photo
exhibition next to the old town square , which satisfied my vision.

That is more or less about my Dresden trip. It is hard to put every
detail in words but I am trying my best! If you would like to add more
about the history of the city please do so! I would also love to know
more it.
